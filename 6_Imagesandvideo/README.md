## DISCRIPTION:
### * IR SENSOR:
An infrared (IR) sensor is an electronic device that measures and detects infrared radiation in its surrounding environment. IR sensor is an electronic device, that emits the light in order to sense some object of the surroundings. An IR sensor can measure the heat of an object as well as detects the motion. Usually, in the infrared spectrum, all the objects radiate some form of thermal radiation. These types of radiations are invisible to our eyes, but infrared sensor can detect these radiations.

### * TEMPERATURE SENSOR:
A temperature sensor is a device that detects and measures hotness and coolness and converts it into an electrical signal. There are different types of temperature sensors available and they each use different technologies and principles to take the temperature measurement.

### * ALCOHOL SENSOR:
An alcohol sensor detects the attentiveness of alcohol gas in the air and an analog voltage is an output reading. It assist officials to find people who have consumed alcohol and ensure they donâ€™t end up doing any dangerous behaviors.

### * HEART BEAT SENSOR:
Heartbeat Sensor is an electronic device that is used to measure the heart rate i.e. speed of the heartbeat. Monitoring body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure are the basic things that we do in order to keep us healthy. An optical heart rate sensor measures pulse waves, which are changes in the volume of a blood vessel that occur when the heart pumps blood. Pulse waves are detected by measuring the change in volume using an optical sensor and green LED.
