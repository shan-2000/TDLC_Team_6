# Drowsy Driver Detection

## Introduction:

Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety technology which helps prevent accidents caused by the driver getting drowsy. Various studies have suggested that around 20% of all road accidents are fatigue-related, up to 50% on certain roads. Drivers must keep a close eye on the road, so they can react to sudden events immediately. Driver fatigue often becomes a direct cause of many traffic accidents. Therefore, there is a need to develop the systems that will detect and notify a driver of her/him bad psychophysical condition, which could significantly reduce the number of fatigue-related car accidents. However, the development of such systems encounters many difficulties related to fast and proper recognition of a driver’s fatigue symptoms. One of the technical possibilities to implement driver drowsiness detection systems is to use the vision-based approach. This article presents the currently used driver drowsiness detection systems. The technical aspects of using the vision system to detect a driver drowsiness are also discussed. Nowadays, more and more professions require long-term concentration. Drivers must keep a close eye on the road, so they can react to sudden events immediately. Driver fatigue often becomes a direct cause of many traffic accidents. Therefore, there is a need to develop the systems that will detect and notify a driver of her/him bad psychophysical condition, which could significantly reduce the number of fatigue-related car accidents. However, the development of such systems encounters many difficulties related to fast and proper recognition of a driver’s fatigue symptoms.In recent years, driver drowsiness has been one of the major causes of road accidents and can lead to severe physical injuries, deaths and significant economic losses. Statistics indicate the need of a reliable driver drowsiness detection system which could alert the driver before a mishap happens. A number of road accidents might then be avoided if an alert is sent to a driver that is deemed drowsy.Drowsy driving is a major problem . The risk, danger, and often tragic results of drowsy driving are alarming. Drowsy driving is the dangerous combination of driving and sleepiness or fatigue. This usually happens when a driver has not slept enough, but it can also happen because of untreated sleep disorders, medications, drinking alcohol, or shift work.No one knows the exact moment when sleep comes over their body. Falling asleep at the wheel is clearly dangerous but being sleepy affects your ability to drive safely even if you don’t fall asleep. 

Drowsiness:

Makes you less able to pay attention to the road.

Slows reaction time if you must brake or steer suddenly.

Affects your ability to make good decisions.

## Application:
### - The action of putting something into operation

• This system can be used in factories to alert
the workers.

• If found drowsy, the alarm system gets
activated and the driver is alerted.

• If there is any obstacles it is alerted to the driver.

• This system can also be used for railway
drivers.

## Objective:
### - Goal of a project

 The main objective of the proposed system is to provide security to a drivers when he is drunken and he feels drowsy. 
 
## Research:
### - The systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions

## 4W and 1H:
### - Is used to comprehend for details, analyze inferences and judgment to get to the fundamental facts and guide statements to get to the abstraction

### __WHO:__ 
* The people those who are working in the dangerous area can use this product to avoid accident due carelessness. 
Several manufacturers, including Audi, Mercedes and Volvo, currently offer drowsiness detection systems that monitor a vehicle's movements, such as steering wheel angle, lane deviation, time driven and road conditions.

### __WHAT:__
* Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving.This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.
* This product is nothing but the alerting system for vehicle driver whenever the driver feeling sleepy the system will give the aleart message. So the posibilities of occuring accidents are low.
* This is why Mercedes-Benz has developed the innovative ATTENTION ASSIST system, which can detect when drivers start to become drowsy and prompt them to take a break before it's too late.likely to suffer a lapse in attention.

### __WHEN:__
* People can use this product when there is a need of providing extra safeness in accident prone areas. 
*Feeling abnormally sleepy or tired during the day is commonly known as drowsiness. Drowsiness may lead to additional symptoms, such as forgetfulness or falling asleep at inappropriate times ,during driving,Drowsiness, also called excess sleepiness, can be accompanied by lethargy, weakness, and lack of mental agility. While most people feel drowsy at some point or another, persistent sleepiness or fatigue, especially at inappropriate times, can indicate a sleep disorder or other medical problem.

### __WHERE:__
* It mostly happens when the driver feels asleep and drowsy inside the car when he is driving.So,Several manufacturers, including Audi, Mercedes and Volvo, currently offer drowsiness detection systems that monitor a vehicle's movements, such as steering wheel angle, lane deviation, time driven and road conditions.

### __HOW:__
* The driver drowsiness detection is based on an algorithm, which begins recording the driver's steering behavior the moment when the driver starts to drive. It then recognizes changes over the course of long journeys, and thus also the driver's level of fatigue.
* A driver who falls asleep at the wheel loses control of the vehicle, an action which often results in a crash with either another vehicle or stationary objects. In order to prevent these devastating accidents, the state of drowsiness of the driver should be monitored.
* If it detects driving behavior consistent with a drowsy driver, the system uses an audible chime sound and displays an amber coffee cup with a message reading, "Take a break?" in the vehicle's information display.DAA is only a warning to inform the driver of a potential lack of driver attention or drowsiness.
How does it work? Driver-monitoring systems typically use a driver-facing camera equipped with infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or lasers so that it can “see” the driver's face, even at night, and see the driver's eyes even if the driver is wearing dark sunglasses.

## Application

1. If found drowsy, the alarm system gets
   activated and the driver is alerted.
2. If there is any obstacles it is alerted to the driver




## Advantages

 1. Security of vehicle. 
 2. Record driving data, collision data and position data. 
 3. Analyze the accidents detail. 
 4. Send location of car and its maintenance to base station through GPS & GSM technique. 
 5. Sense gas & fuel leakage and display its status on car monitoring system. 
 6. Detect if the driver is drunk or not. 
 7. Detect if the driver is feeling sleepy.
 8. The detected abnormal behavior is
corrected through alarms in real time.
 9. Life of the driver can be saved by alerting
him using the alarm system.
 10. Speed of the vehicle can be controlled.
